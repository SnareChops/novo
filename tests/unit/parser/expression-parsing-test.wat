    ;; works correctly with function calls and meta-function calls built-in.
    ;; The test passes if the module linking works correctly.

    ;; Success is validated by successful module instantiation and function import
    ;; which proves the circular dependency issue has been resolved and
    ;; the integrated architecture is sound.
